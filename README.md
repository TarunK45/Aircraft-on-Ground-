Challenge 6: Accelerating Engineering Clearance for AOG Scenarios with Innovative Solutions

In the current challenging and competitive aviation industry, aircraft on the ground due to damage to aircraft need immediate attention in resolving the engineering clearance before they fly back. In this scenario the engineering clearance needs to be given for the specific repairsâ€™ occurrence, Lead time in resolving the issues is especially important as it adds burden to the airliner. Can you propose innovative solutions that resolve minimum lead time with maximum quality output?

Solution: 
1. Risk Analysis and Early Prediction of failure.
2. Supply Chain Management for Parts Repair
3. Augumented Reality for Aircraft Maintenence
